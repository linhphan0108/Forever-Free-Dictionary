        Hi forks,
        \nMy name is Linh, I\'m an Android developer and also an English learner.
        Like other English learners, dictionary is the first essential stuff I must have. It could be considered as a golden key to open the first portal to the English world. So that I have tried dozens of digital dictionaries I could download from the Play Store free of charge. Of course, all them didn\'t satisfied me, bad experiences, ads everywhere,… I even paid for a famous premium one which having millions of downloads from the store.  However I realized it wasn\'t as good as it\'s been supposed to be, right after that. It lacked of vital features to be a good dictionary, no word family, no synonym, no opposite meaning, just American accent sound,… I\'m so disappointed.
        \n"Why don\'t build for myself one? Yeah! Why am I using other person\'s apps While I'm a developer." So that this app went to the world, cool right?.
        \nMy first purpose building this app was just for my personal use. But now I want to share it to all of you who want a free dictionary without ads, additional fee. I will keep it as free as it\'s to be. I promise will never ask you for any a mount of money. So use it as you want.
        As a developer I always want to build a fancy app. if you\'re using this app and happy with it, that would make me happy too. However if you face any problems or have any ideas to improve my app, please feel free to let me know. You can leave a comment on the store or a directly email linhphan0108@gmail.com. all constrictive ideas are welcome.
        \nEnjoy and peace!</string>
